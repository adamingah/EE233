What Does GIT do
	- It manages projects with repositories
	- You clone a project from a source and work on that clone/local copy
	- Control and track changes with Staging and committing
	- Branch and merge allow for different parts and versions of a project
	- "Pull" pulls the latest version of the project to a local directory
	- "Push" pushes local updates to the main project

GIT NEW FILES
	- "mkdir ____ " makes a new directory/file where ever you are
`	- "touch ___.html" Will make a new html file, but you can switch the file extension out
	- "git status" will tell you what files aren't added to the repository
	- "git add --all" and "git add -A" will add all files in a directory, to be committed 

COMMITTING NEW FILES
	- git commit -m "blah blah blah blah" 
		-> -m is for message, you should always have a message included with the commit.

GIT HELP
	- "git help -all" shows you all the possible commands
	- "git command -help" shows you all the available options for the specific command
	- "git help" is just very general

WORKING WITH GIT BRANCHES
	- A branch is a new/separate version of the main repository
	- Edit code without impacting the live branch
	- Can fix error and merge the error-free code with the main branch.
	- "git branch ____" creates a branch named ____.
	- "git checkout ____" switches us to another branch
